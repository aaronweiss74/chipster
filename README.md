Take on the retro gaming and get crackin' as an indie game developer for the retro CHIP-8 interpreter! You'll be the envy of all your hipster friends!


### What? ###
chipster is a fast emulator for the [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) system using [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/). It was made for the purpose of learning more about emulation. Quite frankly, there's a million of them and this one is nothing special. Try it out, take it for a spin, or just move along. I won't blame you.
